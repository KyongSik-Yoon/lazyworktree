# Documentation Rules

When updating documentation:

- **British spelling**: Use British English spelling throughout (colour, behaviour, initialise).
- **Professional butler style**: Clear, helpful, dignified but not pompous.
- **Three-way sync**: Keep README.md, lazyworktree.1 (man page), and help screen in sync.
- **Feature completeness**: When adding features or keybindings, update all three sources.
- **Man page format**: Follow troff/groff formatting conventions for the man page.
- **Technical precision**: Maintain accuracy whilst ensuring readability.
